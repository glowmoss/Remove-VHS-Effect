# Remove-VHS


In this repo I will mostly just have cheat tables that will remove the vhs effect from games. 
There may be other options depending on how long I mess about with the game. It will probably mainly be unity games


Currently There is
- Fears to Fathom Episodes 1-5
- Northbury Grove 1 (I know there is a toggle but it has to be toggled all the time where this works everywhere and doesn't remove the camera ui)
- I will probably add more northbury grove games and maybe add more stuff to the first ones table at some point
